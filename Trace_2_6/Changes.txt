-Removed on screen debug text
-Corrected errors with sizing of Y and Z 'Time' measurement arraylists
	-Corrected direction of the Z 'Time' measurements (i.e. it now moves into the screen)
-Added camera. Camera can zoom and rotate around the origin.
-I don't think RGB can be used for color in this way, so I'm removing it
-Added logging option (logs the data in a trace to csv)
-Panning with camera (right mouse drag)
-Added HUD to trace display window
	-button to return to addtrace page
	-hide HUD (hides everything except for the hide button)
	-change background color
	-Change trace 'speed' (a factor for the 'time' measurement)
-Added axes (x, y, z lines and numbered labels)
-Flipped y-axis plotting. In 3D space increasing y goes down, so now it's made negative before drawing (so increasing y goes up) 
-Modify the way that traces are drawn and the way use of the 'time' measurement is noted, allowing for multiple 'time' axes to be used in a single trace
-Format measurement readings (limit displayed digits)
-Added the ability to delete traces (currently all at once; a scrollable dropdown could be added)
-Removed 'QUIT' button; pressing the X in the corner of the frame is now sufficient to trigger all necessary closing actions
-Changed name of file to Trace
-Issue fixed: Background color and camera position are now preserved when going back and forth between setup display and trace display
-Issue Fixed: Dragging on the color wheel or speed slider no longer drags the background
	-Edit: This is un-fixed to some extent
-The SETUP_DISPLAY is now drawn on the HUD; i.e. the camera is always active. It's easier this way.
-Allows window resizing (without breaking)
-Can delete traces (logs are closed out upon deletion)
-Connection can be established after startup (COM port selection, Baud rate, and normalization parameter)
	-Scrollable lists for COM connection are no longer overlapped by other elements
	-Connection can be broken to release the connected device and port
	-No longer attempts a connection on startup
-Added the ability to change limits of X, Y, and Z axes

Need to
-Have a dedicated fullscreen option, have screen resizing as a toggle-able option (to, hopefully, get rid of the camera issues)
	-Or, figure out/fix the camera issue
	-Or, write a new camera
-Add trace math, including smoothing
-Edit trace properties manually (color, length - on HUD)
-Remove unused dimension checkbox, or add RGB back in
-HUD
	-button/box to toggle axes on/off
-Add audio data selection to menus (not COM menu; checkbox dropdowns? Left and right channels separately)
-Increase camera render distance

-Optional indicator where camera is looking
-Option to give the camera a new lookat point
-Change default trace color as traces are added
-Add FFT
-Make text larger (is this possible with controlp5?)
-Option of displaying measurements on screen
-Allow Trace to send things over serial (in addition to receiving them)
